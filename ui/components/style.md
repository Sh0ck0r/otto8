1. Please always push class as visually the last thing because it's long and runs off the screen, you don't want a hidden attribute after it
2. don't try to extract out classes to much, you are just reinventing css classes which suck
3. don't overly design components. build one component for a task you are working, don't create multiple components until it's obvious it's useful
